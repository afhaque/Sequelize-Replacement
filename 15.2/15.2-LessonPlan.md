## 15.2 Lesson Plan - Getting In The CRUD with Sequelize

### Overview
In today's class, we'll introduce new Sequelize methods for updating and deleting records with as well as introduce some useful validations.

##### Instructor Priorities:

* Students should know how to perform each CRUD action using Sequelize, as well as understand how to use the "where" query attribute to specify which rows they want to effect.
* Students should become more comfortable converting a project using a different ORM to use sequelize, as well as understand what's needed to set Sequelize up from scratch.
* Student's should also understand how through the use of validations on their models, they can restrict what type of data can be saved into their databases.

##### Instructor Notes:

* Once again, **THIS IS TOUGH STUFF!** This week, tell your class to not feel discouraged if there are concepts that they can't nail down completely. Tell them to try their best, but to speak with you or a TA if they're unsure of anything.

* Be sure to look at the solutions to each activity before the lecture begins, and to run the server files in each folder to see how they should run.

* Again, **BE VERY CAREFUL TO NOT GO TOO IN DEPTH.** There are a ton of working parts in these directories, but focus on what we mention in the lesson plan.


-------

### Class Objectives

* To provide students a refresher on setting up a project to work with Sequelize.
* To review the creation of models using Sequelize.
* To review Sequelize CRUD methods introduced in the last class and to introduce methods for updating and deleting database entries.
* To introduce the concept of validations and how they can be used to further restrict what kind of data can be stored in the database.
* To highlight the importance of chaining .then methods to take data from one call and pass it into another, especially in the context of Sequelize.

--------

### 0. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (1 min).
* Say your hellos and welcome your class.

### 1. Instructor Do: Pulse Check and Sequelize Review (10 min)
* Ask students how the week is going so far, and what they think of Sequelize.
	* Answer any questions students might have about using the package

* Give them a quick back and forth on some of the basics of Sequelize.
	* What is Sequelize?
		* An ORM designed for Node that lets users handle complex SQL database queries with JavaScript methods, rather than typing out SQL code.

	* What is a Sequelize model.
		* a representation of a table as a JavaScript object that Sequelize uses to help expedite the coding of data queries.

	* What Sequelize CRUD methods did we already go over?
		* findOne, findAll, create

### 2. Instructor Do: TodoList Demo (10 mins)

* Praise your students for picking up the concepts you just discussed, but just to be sure you're on the same plane, you have an exercise for them to do.

* Inform students that today they are going to play the role of a backend developer. We have a todo list app that previously was using a simple ORM to communicate with a database, but now we're coming in to perform a few upgrades.

* Open the folder [1-TodoList-ORM](Activities/1-TodoList-ORM) and run the schema.sql file followed by `npm install` and then `node server`. Navigate to localhost:8080 and explain to your students that they will be converting this todo list app to use sequelize instead of the ORM it's currently using. Let students know that this application makes use of each CRUD action. It allows the user to CREATE new todo items, it READS todos from the database, it allows the user to UPDATE current todo items, and allows a user to DELETE todos. Be sure to demonstrate this functionality to the class. Inform them that they will be converting one piece of functionality at a time, and things will inevitably break temporarily while we're doing that. Inform students they won't need to (and shouldn't) touch any front end javascript or HTML.

* Answer any questions before the exercise begins.

### 3. Warm Up: Connect to Sequelize and Create a Todo Model (25 mins)
Slack out the following file [filename](filenamepath) and instructions

```
/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1) Create a new local MYSQL database called 'todolist'.
 * 2) Delete any references to the orm.js file inside the `api-routes.js` file.
 * 3) Replace all of the code inside connection.js with new code to connect to your database with sequelize.
 * 4) Inside of the app folder, create a `models` folder and inside a new file called `todo.js`.
 * 5) Define a Todo model with 2 columns. `text` with a type of Sequelize.STRING, and `complete` with a type of Sequelize.BOOLEAN.
 * 6) Sync the Todo model, and then export it.
 * 7) Require your Todo model inside of your api-routes file and save it to a variable named `Todo`.
 * 8) From your terminal, run `node server` and check MYSQL workbench to see if a `Todos` table was created. If so then this was successful.

```
### 4. Instructor Do: Review the ORM-To-Sequelize Activity (10 mins)
* When time's up, load up the solution on your machine. Be sure to show students your connection.js file as well as your Todo model. Highlight the fact that we sync() our model before exporting it. This is what ensures our table is created and ready when we try and use the Todo model in other files.

* Show them where the Todo model is required inside of the api-routes.js file where we will eventually use it.

* If you already have a Todos table in your todolist database, delete this and show students how the table it remade for us when you run `node server`.

* Answer any questions before moving on to the next exercise.

### 5. Instructor Do: Review findAll and create (10 mins)

* Have the class walk you through including the findAll method in the `/api/todos` GET route and the create method in the `/api/todos` POST route.

* Answer any questions.

### 6. Instructor Demo: update and delete (5 mins)
* Inform students that now they will be working on functionality to delete todos and to update todos.

* Open the solved file and run the program. Show students how they can delete todo items by clicking the `x` button on the todo. Refresh the page to prove that todo is gone.

* Demonstrate how when clicking a todo item, you can update the todos text. Refresh the page again to prove this works.

* Slack out the following file and instructions.

  * [`3-Sequelize-update-destroy-unsolved`](Activities/2-Joins-Refresher).
  ```
  /* INSTRUCTIONS:
   * 1) Open the file slacked out to you
   * 2) Run `npm install`
   * 3) Inside the api-routes.js file, look for the `/api/todos/:id` DELETE route and use the sequelize destroy method to delete the row with the id provided.
   * 4) Inside of the same file, look for the `/api/todos` PUT route and use the sequelize update method to update a new record into the Todos table. The updated todo object will be in req.body.
   * 5) You won't need to touch the front end HTML or JavaScript to make this work.
   * 6) BIG HINT: you will need to pass in a "where" object into your method in order to filter these queries to target the Todos you want. http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/querying/#where
   * 6) Navigate to localhost:8080 to check if you were successful.
   * -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/ */
  ```

### 5. Instructor Do: Review Update and Destroy (10 mins)
* Have students explain to you how how the "where" {where: ''} object works when it comes to filtering the records you want to update or delete.

* Demo the completed application.

* Tell them that while these joins might have seemed complicated, it doesn't have to be so complex. Sequelize takes a lot of the burden off of making these Associations.

* Inform students that now that they have a good grasp on CRUD actions with sequelize, as well as how to filter queries with "where", they already know how to do what they'll be doing %80 of the time.

* Answer any remaining questions.

* Explain to students that the Sequelize documentation is in fact difficult to navigate. All of the model methods can be found here. http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/api/model/

* Slack out the Sequelize CRUD actions cheat sheet.

### 6. Instructor Do: Validations (5 mins)
* Explain to the class that as some of them may have already noticed, there's a small flaw with our todolist application. And that is that while our Todos table's text column won't save any data type other than a Sequelize.STRING or VARCHAR (255), it is possible to save an empty todo.

* While it is possible to restrict this functionality client side (and we we should), if someone knew how to use Chrome Developer Tools, they could circumvent any restrictions we put in our front end javascript.

* Knowing that any code we write on the client is potentially available for the user to tamper with. Or more so than just making sure the string isn't blank, how can we check that our todo's text is under a maximum length?

### 7. Everyone Do: Discuss With Partners (10 mins)

* Have the class discuss with their partners for about few minutes what options we may have to further restrict what kinds of data can be saved into our Todos table.

* After a few minutes have the volunteers suggest their solutions. Most likely suggestions will be to have an if conditional that checks the value before trying to insert it. Some may suggest that Sequelize may have something for this.

* Inform students that Sequelize has build in validations and flags we can include with our models. Popular validations include making sure that text is a URL or email, or that a credit card number is formatted correctly. Popular flags include making sure a value is not null before before entering it into the database or having a default value for a field if one is not supplied. Sequelize even allows you to easily create your own validations.

### 8. Students Do: Sequelize Validations (15 mins)
* Slack out the following file and instructions. Sequelize validations.

```
/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 * 1) Open the file slacked out to you
 * 2) Run `npm install`
 * 3) Modify the todo.js file so that the Todo model to have a flag to prevent the text field from being null. Also add a validation to make sure the text field is at least one character, but no more than 140 characters.
 * 4) Modify the complete field in our Todo model so that it supplies a default value of false if one is not supplied during Todo creation.
 * 5) Once a Sequelize model has been created and sync'ed, any changes we make to our Todo model won't be picked up by our database. The easiest way to get around this during the development process is to pass { force: true } into our Todo.sync() method inside todo.js file. Todo.sync({ force: true }). This will make it so that every time we run our app, our Todos table will be dropped and recreated with the new configuration.
 * 6) Navigate to localhost:8080 to test that this worked. Try to save a todo without any text in it, and then try and save a todo with over 140 characters. If you see errors in your console that have to do with validation, you were successful.

```


### 9. Instructor: Explain Error Handling (5 mins)

* Demonstrate to students that while our validations work, they throw errors whenever they fail, crashing our entire node application.

* This is Sequelize's default behavior. If we had our app deployed to Heroku with actual users, these types of errors would cause the site to go down.

* Thankfully Sequelize has a built in catch() method we can use in order to gracefully handle any errors without crashing our entire app.

* Demonstrate adding a catch promise to the end of each Sequelize method inside of the api-routes.js file. Simply console.log the error. Show students how now when we try and do something our validations prohibit, we can still use our app. Also be sure to show students how we're handling the errors by console.logging them.

* Answer any remaining questions and start the next activity.

### 9. Students Do: Final Activity (60 mins)

* Students will form groups and will build a blogging CMS app from scratch.

* The app should have at least two views:
	* 1) A main view for writing blog posts. At the minimum this view needs a text-area for writing the blog body, an input field for writing the blog title, and a dropdown for selecting a blog category (personal, instructional, product review, etc). Additionally this view will need a button for submitting posts.
	* 2) A view for displaying all blog posts category. Here there should be a way to sort posts by category. Maybe a dropdown.

* The app should use jQuery or handlebars (or both)

* There should be API routes for retrieving and posting blog items. As a bonus, try and incorporate editing and deleting posts.

* There should be validation on the back end preventing the user from entering bad information.

### 10. Instructor: Dismiss Class (5 mins)

* Tell class that they just covered a lot of ground today. If they feel they haven't caught onto everything we just went over, encourage them to check out the solution files and the documentation. Of course, they can also talk to you or a TA between classes for one-on-one advice.

* Inform them that they have one more association to go over, the most complex, but also the most powerful. Add in that with everything they went over today, it won't be nearly as hard as they might think. And it sure beats doing this with pure SQL queries.

* Class dismissed.
